# Print leaf nodes from preorder traversal of BST

Given a preorder traversal of a BST, find the leaf nodes of the tree without building the tree.

<b>Example 1:</b>
```
Input:
N = 2
arr = {2,1}
Output: {1}
Explaination: 1 is the only leaf node.
```

<b>Example 2:</b>

```
Input:
N = 3
Arr = {3, 2, 4}
Output: {2, 4}
Explaination: 2, 4 are the leaf nodes.
```

<b>Expected Time Complexity: O(N)</b>

<b>Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)</b>
